## Private endpoint
An Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects your virtual network privately to a service powered by Azure Private Link. This allows you to access Azure services over an Azure Private Link, which is a private endpoint in your virtual network. This means that traffic between your virtual network and the service traverses over the Microsoft Azure backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.
