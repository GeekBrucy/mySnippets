# By default

- By default, your Lambda function is launched outside your own VPC (in an AWS-owned VPC)
- Therefore, it cannot access resources in your VPC (RDS, ElastiCache, internal ELBâ€¦)

# Lambda in VPC

- You must define the VPC ID, the Subnets and the Security Groups
- Lambda will create an ENI (Elastic Network Interface) in your subnets

# Lambda with RDS Proxy

- If Lambda functions directly access your database, they may open too many connections under high load
- RDS Proxy
  - Improve scalability by pooling and sharing DB connections
  - Improve availability by reducing by 66% the failover time and preserving connections
  - Improve security by enforcing IAM authentication and storing credentials in Secrets Manager
- The Lambda function must be deployed in your VPC, because RDS Proxy is never publicly accessible
