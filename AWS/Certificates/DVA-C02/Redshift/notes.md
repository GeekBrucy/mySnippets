- In Amazon Redshift, you can enable database encryption for your clusters to help protect data at rest. When you enable encryption for a cluster, the data blocks and system metadata are encrypted for the cluster and its snapshots.
  - Encryption is an optional, immutable setting of a cluster. If you want encryption, you enable it during the cluster launch process. As of October 2018, you can enable encryption on an un-encrypted cluster and AWS will handle migrating the data over to a new, encrypted cluster behind-the-scenes.
