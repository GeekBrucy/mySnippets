# Caching Strategies
- [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/Strategies.html)

## Lazy loading
- allows for stale data but wonâ€™t fail with empty nodes

## Write-through
- Ensures that data is always fresh but may fail with empty nodes and may populate the cache with superfluous data

## Adding TTL
- By adding a time to live (TTL) value to each write, we are able to enjoy the advantages of each strategy and largely avoid cluttering up the cache with superfluous data.
