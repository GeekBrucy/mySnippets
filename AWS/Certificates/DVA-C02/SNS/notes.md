- By default, a subscriber of an Amazon SNS topic receives every message published to the topic. To receive only a subset of the messages, a subscriber assigns a filter policy to the topic subscription.
  - A filter policy is a simple JSON object. The policy contains attributes that define which messages the subscriber receives. When you publish a message to a topic, Amazon SNS compares the message attributes to the attributes in the filter policy for each of the topicâ€™s subscriptions. If there is a match between the attributes, Amazon SNS sends the message to the subscriber. Otherwise, Amazon SNS skips the subscriber without sending the message to it. If a subscription lacks a filter policy, the subscription receives every message published to its topic.
