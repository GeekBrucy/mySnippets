- For web distributions, to control how long your objects stay in a CloudFront cache before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin, you can:
  - Configure your origin to add a Cache-Control or an Expires header field to each object.
  - Specify a value for Minimum TTL in CloudFront cache behaviors.
    - Use the default value of 24 hours.
