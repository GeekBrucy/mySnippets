- Amazon Cognito identity pools support both authenticated and unauthenticated identities. Authenticated identities belong to users who are authenticated by any supported identity provider. Unauthenticated identities typically belong to guest users.

- Amazon Cognito Sync is an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of application-related user data. You can use it to synchronize user profile data across mobile devices and web applications. The client libraries cache data locally so your app can read and write data regardless of device connectivity status. When the device is online, you can synchronize data, and if you set up push sync, notify other devices immediately that an update is available.
