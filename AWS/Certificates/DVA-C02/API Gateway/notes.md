- In API Gateway, a deployment is represented by a Deployment resource. It is like an executable of an API represented by a RestApi resource. For the client to call your API, you must create a deployment and associate a stage to it. A stage is represented by a Stage resource and represents a snapshot of the API, including methods, integrations, models, mapping templates, Lambda authorizers (formerly known as custom authorizers), etc

- For example, with DynamoDB as the backend, the API developer sets up the integration request to forward the incoming method request to the chosen backend. The setup includes specifications of an appropriate DynamoDB action, required IAM role and policies, and required input data transformation. The backend returns the result to API Gateway as an integration response. To route the integration response to an appropriate method response (of a given HTTP status code) to the client, you can configure the integration response to map required response parameters from integration to method
