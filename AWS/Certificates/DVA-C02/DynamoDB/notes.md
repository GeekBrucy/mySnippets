- You can use Global secondary indexes and use only those attributes which will be queried. This can help reduce the amount of read throughput used on the table.

- If possible, you should avoid using a Scan operation on a large table or index with a filter that removes many results. Also, as a table or index grows, the Scan operation slows. The Scan operation examines every item for the requested values and can use up the provisioned throughput for a large table or index in a single operation. For faster response times, design your tables and indexes so that your applications can use Query instead of Scan. (For tables, you can also consider using the GetItem and BatchGetItem APIs.)

- Keep the number of indexes to a minimum. Don’t create secondary indexes on attributes that you don’t query often. Indexes that are seldom used contribute to increased storage and I/O costs without improving application performance.
  - Avoid indexing tables that experience heavy write activity. In a data capture application, for example, the cost of I/O operations required to maintain an index on a table with a very high write load can be significant. If you need to index data in such a table, it may be more effective to copy the data to another table that has the necessary indexes and query it there.
