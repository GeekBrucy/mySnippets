- Instance metadata is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance
  - Because your instance metadata is available from your running instance, you do not need to use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI. This can be helpful when youâ€™re writing scripts to run from your instance. For example, you can access the local IP address of your instance from instance metadata to manage a connection to an external application.
