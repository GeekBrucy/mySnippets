- The AWS RDS Service contains several logs such as the ones given below

  - **Error log** – contains diagnostic messages generated by the database engine, along with startup and shutdown times.
  - **General query log** – contains a record of all SQL statements received from clients, and also client connect and disconnect times.
  - **Slow query log** – contains a record of SQL statements that took longer to execute than a set amount of time and that examined more than a defined number of rows. Both thresholds are configurable.

- Before you can connect to a DB instance running the MySQL database engine, you must create a DB instance. For information, see Creating a DB Instance Running the MySQL Database Engine. Once Amazon RDS provisions your DB instance, you can use any standard MySQL client application or utility to connect to the instance. In the connection string, you specify the DNS address from the DB instance endpoint as the host parameter and specify the port number from the DB instance endpoint as the port parameter.
  - You can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI describe-db-instances command, or the Amazon RDS API DescribeDBInstances action to list the details of an Amazon RDS DB instance, including its endpoint
